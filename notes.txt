Note: validations are for the model.  Constraints are defined inside migrations.


https://github.com/appacademy/curriculum/blob/master/sql/projects/url_shortener/solution/db/migrate/20170708074429_create_shortened_urls.rb

is a good reference for migrations



Questions:
  1.  Should it be save! or save in user.  I think save! to create errors.



 user = User.new({username: 'abc'})

1. make account
2. login
3. establish remote
4. build packs in setting, node.js, THEN ruby
5. then in package JSON add "postinstall" "webpack"
6. then go to engines and check version of npm and node



7. you have to run migrations to get it to heroku
8. heroku run should go first


1. be careful about cSS
you can't drop the database, you can only migrate and seed


migrate and seed

I put this in application.js --> //= require jquery
remember that if it is gem testing and not in development/test it can be available everywhere


Note: error messages in the model are from the JSON


$.ajax({method: 'POST', url: '/api/users', data: { user: { username: 'chewbacca', password: 'starwars' }}});
