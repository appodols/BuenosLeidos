Note: validations are for the model.  Constraints are defined inside migrations.


https://github.com/appacademy/curriculum/blob/master/sql/projects/url_shortener/solution/db/migrate/20170708074429_create_shortened_urls.rb

Questions:
  1.  Should it be save! or save in user.  I think save! to create errors.
