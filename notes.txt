Note: validations are for the model.  Constraints are defined inside migrations.


https://github.com/appacademy/curriculum/blob/master/sql/projects/url_shortener/solution/db/migrate/20170708074429_create_shortened_urls.rb

is a good reference for migrations



Questions:
  1.  Should it be save! or save in user.  I think save! to create errors.



 user = User.new({username: 'abc'})

1. make account
2. login
3. establish remote
4. build packs in setting, node.js, THEN ruby
5. then in package JSON add "postinstall" "webpack"
6. then go to engines and check version of npm and node



7. you have to run migrations to get it to heroku
8. heroku run should go first


1. be careful about cSS
you can't drop the database, you can only migrate and seed


migrate and seed

I put this in application.js --> //= require jquery
remember that if it is gem testing and not in development/test it can be available everywhere


Note: error messages in the model are from the JSON


$.ajax({method: 'POST', url: '/api/users', data: { user: { username: 'chewbacca', password: 'starwars' }}});


Would love to use helpers and understand what those do


Note we should make filnames in snake, and the name of the stuff in the file in camel

db:migrate runs (single) migrations that have not run yet.
db:create creates the database
db:drop deletes the database
db:schema:load creates tables and columns within the (existing) database following schema.rb

db:setup does db:create, db:schema:load, db:seed

db:reset does db:drop, db:setup
Typically, you would use db:migrate after having made changes to the schema via new migration files (this makes sense only if there is already data in the database). db:schema:load is used when you setup a new instance of your app.

I hope that helps.
//why are we passing ownProps through dispatch? Is this so I can access it in the actual form?



NOTE: we have not yet run the command form npm-install save yet.

Questions: why do we keep getting that on SIGNIN?
